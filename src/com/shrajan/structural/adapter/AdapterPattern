***********************************************
Adaptee :- The external library
Target  :- Expected Interface 
Adapter :- The one which enables Target to make use of Adaptee


E.g. You need to integrate 3rd party library into your project.

Now the problem is your code (Target) is anticipating
JSON format however  3rd party works with XML only(Adaptee)

To marry them together you need an adapter

/** Object Adapter uses Composition as in our Class Adapter
it implements target interface and uses composition
to encapsulate incompatible 3rd party Adaptee**/

/** Class Adapter uses inheritance it extends Adaptee and Implements Target ***/

When to use Object Adapter vs Class Adapter ?

If flexibility is crucial and you want to adapt multiple classes or interfaces at runtime,
 Object Adapter might be preferred due to its composition-based approach.
 
 If you need to override behavior or access protected members of the class being adapted, 
 the Class Adapter might be a better choice due to its ability to inherit directly.
 
 If you're working with an existing codebase that heavily utilizes inheritance, 
 the Class Adapter might fit more seamlessly.
