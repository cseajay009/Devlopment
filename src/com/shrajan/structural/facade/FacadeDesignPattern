The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of
interfaces in a subsystem. It simplifies and abstracts complex functionality behind a simpler interface, making it easier to use.

Key Components:
Facade:


Represents the simplified interface that interacts with the complex subsystem. 
It encapsulates and delegates the client's requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem.


Subsystems:
Consist of various classes, each handling a specific part of the functionality. 
These classes work together to achieve complex tasks.


Multimedia Facade is exposing only limited functionality of the library. 
To avoid code smell it just focus on required feature and exposes them to the client
