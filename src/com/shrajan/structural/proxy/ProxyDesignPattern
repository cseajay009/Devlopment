The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
 It allows the creation of a representative object that can serve as a placeholder for another object, providing controlled access to it.

Key Components:
Subject:

Interface or abstract class defining the common interface for the RealSubject and Proxy.
RealSubject:

The real object that the Proxy represents. This object is the one the client wants to access.
Proxy:

Acts as a substitute for the RealSubject, 
implementing the same interface. It controls access to the RealSubject, 
adding extra functionalities like caching, logging, or controlling access permissions.
